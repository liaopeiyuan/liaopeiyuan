I'm currently a machine learning lead at Praxis Pioneering. I care deeply about creating human-level engineering intelligence and supporting them with the computing infrastructure of the future. In my past life, I was a top-ranking competitive machine learning engineer on Kaggle, an intern at a crypto unicorn and a MLSaaS startup, and a researcher at CMU's Catalyst Group working on deep learning compilers.
