I'm currently a machine learning lead at Praxis Pioneering. I'm interested in algorithmic autonomy, emergent techniques in computing, perception, and various forms of machine intelligence. In my past life, I was a top-ranking competitor on Kaggle, and a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University working with Ruslan Salakhutdinov on representation learning and Tianqi Chen on deep learning compilers.
