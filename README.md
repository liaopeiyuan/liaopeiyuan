## Peiyuan Liao

*When in doubt, Unsafe.Coerce*

I help organize an [academic retreat in Beijing](https://luntan.io/).

I also write code for [a Pittsburgh-Chicago-based startup on real-time capture solutions for virtual personalities and youtubers/livers/“UP主” (uploaders)](planemirror.tech).

While at school, I focused/am focusing on topics that live in the intersection of machine learning, systems engineering and programming language theory. I've had the honor of working with Han Zhao and Keyulu Xu on graph neural networks in the past.
