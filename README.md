I'm currently a machine learning lead at Praxis Pioneering. I care deeply about creating human-level engineering intelligence and supporting them with the computing infrastructure of the future. In my past life, I was a top-ranking competitive machine learning engineer on Kaggle, and a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University working with Ruslan Salakhutdinov on representation learning and Tianqi Chen on deep learning compilers.
