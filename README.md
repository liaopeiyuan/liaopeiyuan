I am an open-source enthusiast and currently a machine learning engineer at a startup. I am also working towards an undergraduate degree in computer science at Carnegie Mellon University. I'm interested in creating fun and smart systems at scale. 

Some awesome communities I'm involved with: [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com/), [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com/alexanderliao), [Lantern](https://lun-tan.com/)
